# here we specify our workflows, most of which are conditionally
# executed based upon pipeline parameter values. Each workflow calls a
# specific job defined above, in the jobs section.
workflows:
  # when pipeline parameter, run-build-service-1-job is true, the
  # build-service-1 job is triggered.
  service-1:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.testing >>
    jobs:
      - testing
  # when pipeline parameter, run-build-service-2-job is true, the
  # build-service-2 job is triggered.
  service-2:
    when: << pipeline.parameters.testing-1 >>
    jobs:
      - testing-1
  # when pipeline parameter, run-build-service-1-job OR
  # run-build-service-2-job is true, run-integration-tests job is
  # triggered. see:
